# Step 1: TMCbeans (if not already familiar with Java)

* Follow links and finish parts 1-4, 9, 10  
    -  **Once you reach part 4ish or if you have some knowledge, you can come talk to one of the heads to skip the rest**  
* [Installation](https://www.mooc.fi/en/installation/netbeans/) \- follow the instructions in ths link  
* [downloads](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t-E3pMgO3RraraP4Stzuldlk5Y7dOQaQ) \- get tshe tmcbeans and java downloads from here  
* [actual course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) \- make an account and start 

This can get boring, so you can skip exercises that you don't feel you need. The most important part is really Part 9 about Object Oriented Programming.

**Once you are done, or if you want to skip this step, come talk to one of the heads about the next steps.**

If none of us are available, your next step is to install WPILIB VS Code. Wpilib VS Code is the editor we use to program robots, and it has a bunch of integrations that make it easier to write and run code for robots. **To get started follow [this guide](Supplementals/Intro-to-Wpilib.md) to install Wpilib and make your first project.** 

**Once you have done that, contact one of the leads for next steps.**

If none of us are available, **read through [Wpilib's command based programming guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html) and the [how to make a command guide](Supplementals/How-to-Make-a-Command.md), and get started on step 2.**
